# Indonesian Ancestor Statues Application

This application is made as an assignment for the course Frontend Applications for Communication & Multimedia Design at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. In cooperation with the Museum of Volkenkunde the assignment entails building an application that makes use of their newly published collection database. 

This application will show all their Indonesian Ancestor Statues and information about those. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/lennartdeknikker/frontend-applications/wiki/Application-design) for more pictures of the initial product design.
