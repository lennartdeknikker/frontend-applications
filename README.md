# Indonesian Ancestor Statues Application

This application is made as an assignment for the course Frontend Applications for [Communication & Multimedia Design](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/english/) at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. In cooperation with the [Museum of Volkenkunde](https://www.volkenkunde.nl/en), the assignment entails building an application that makes use of their newly published collection database using [Angular](https://angular.io/) as a framework. 

This application will show all their Indonesian Ancestor Statues and information about those. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/lennartdeknikker/frontend-applications/wiki/Application-design) for more pictures of the initial product design and additional information on the building process and featured components.
